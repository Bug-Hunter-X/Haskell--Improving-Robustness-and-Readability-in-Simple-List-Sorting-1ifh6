```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers :: [Int] = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers :: [Int] = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers

--Example of improved error handling (though not strictly necessary for this simple example)

sortWithErrorHandler :: (Ord a, Show a) => [a] -> IO ()
sortWithErrorHandler xs = do
  case xs of
    [] -> putStrLn "Empty list provided."
    _ -> print (sort xs) 
```
The solution adds explicit type annotations (`:: [Int]`) for improved clarity and type safety. While the original example doesn't necessitate extensive error handling, `sortWithErrorHandler` illustrates how one might add error management for more complex scenarios, handling potential empty lists and ensuring that the list elements are of comparable types.
