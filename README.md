# Haskell: Enhancing Robustness and Readability in List Sorting

This repository demonstrates a simple Haskell program that sorts a list of numbers. While functionally correct, the code lacks robust error handling and explicit type annotations, common issues in Haskell development.  The `bug.hs` file shows the initial, less robust version, while `bugSolution.hs` presents an improved solution.

**Key improvements in `bugSolution.hs`:**

* **Explicit type annotations:**  Improves code readability and enables the compiler to perform more thorough type checking.
* **Error handling:** Includes more comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential exceptions or unexpected input types.

This example highlights the importance of writing robust and maintainable Haskell code, even for seemingly straightforward tasks.
