```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code compiles and runs without errors, but it doesn't explicitly handle potential exceptions or edge cases that might arise in a more complex real-world scenario.  For example, it assumes the input list `numbers` will always contain only numbers and won't throw an error if it receives unexpected input types.  A more robust solution should include error handling.

Another subtle issue is the lack of explicit type annotations for `numbers` and `sortedNumbers`. While Haskell's type inference system is powerful, explicit annotations improve readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects.  This can also help catch potential type-related errors during compilation.
